A localized adaptation of [ChatLaw](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ChatLaw) for the Indian legal system.  
This project aims to develop a legal large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on Indian laws, statutes, and case data to provide accurate legal responses specific to the Indian legal context.

---

## üìå Overview

This project is inspired by the [ChatLaw](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ChatLaw) model developed for Chinese legal systems. We adapt the methodology, training pipeline, and data structuring to the domain of **Indian laws** including:

- Indian Penal Code (IPC)
- Civil laws
- Case law judgments
- Constitution of India
- Legal proceedings in multiple jurisdictions

### Justifiaction of MultiAgent Architecture
The use of a multi-agent architecture in the ChatLaw model is crucial for delivering accurate and reliable legal services, 
particularly in addressing the persistent challenge of hallucinations often found in large language models. By dividing the 
consultation process into specialized roles‚ÄîLegal Assistant, Legal Researcher, Senior Lawyer, and Legal Editor‚Äîthe system ensures 
that each stage of legal reasoning is handled with domain-specific focus and verification.
    This modular design allows the Legal Researcher to actively retrieve and verify the latest legal statutes and precedents from 
trusted external sources, countering the risk of outdated or fabricated content generated by the base model. The Legal Assistant 
builds a structured knowledge graph to clarify and disambiguate user input, reducing the ambiguity that often leads to hallucinated 
responses. Meanwhile, the Senior Lawyer provides advisory content within a ‚Äúfirewall‚Äù framework that filters out speculative or 
unsupported statements. Finally, the Legal Editor ensures that only factually grounded and well-cited information makes it into the 
final output. Together, this collaborative architecture acts as a layered defense system, rigorously validating inputs and outputs 
to minimize factual errors and reinforce the model‚Äôs credibility and safety in high-stakes legal contexts.

A localized adaptation of [ChatLaw](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ChatLaw) for the Indian legal system.  
This project aims to develop a legal large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on Indian laws, statutes, and case data to provide accurate legal responses specific to the Indian legal context.

- Civil laws
- Case law judgments
- Constitution of India
- Legal proceedings in multiple jurisdictions
